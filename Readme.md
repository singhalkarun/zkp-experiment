### Prover needs to know correct private inputs and can generate a witness and then a proof using those, which he has to share with verifier to be able to prove that he knows the input.


### Verifier has a verification key and inst.json which contains public signals including input and output and a proof from the prover. We can use snarks and 3 of these files to validate if proof is valid.
